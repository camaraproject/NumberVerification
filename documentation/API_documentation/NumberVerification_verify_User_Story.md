| **Item** | **Details** |

| ***Summary*** | As an application developer, I want to verify the phone number associated with a mobile connection so I can validate the phone number identity that a end-user introduces in my application during a registration process.|
| ***Actors and Scope*** | **Actors:** Application service provider (ASP), ASP:User, ASP: BusinessManager, ASP:Administrator, Channel Partner, End-User, Communication Service Provider (CSP). <br> **Scope:**  <br> - Verifies if the specified phone number (plain text or hashed format) matches the one that the user is currently using. |
