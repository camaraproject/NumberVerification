This **public release** contains the definition and documentation of
* number-verification 2.0.0

The API definition(s) are based on
* Commonalities v0.5.0
* Identity and Consent Management v0.3.0

## number-verification 2.0.0

**number-verification 2.0.0 is the public release for v2.0.0 of the NumberVerification API.**

The NumberVerification API version has been upgraded from previous v1.0.0 to v2.0.0 even though the functionality updates included in this version do not contain any breaking change.
However, the inclusion of a new supported authentication method (CIBA+TS.43 temporary token) to enable the use of the API over Wifi, justifies the generation of a new major version of the API.

# ~~r2.3~~

**Release r2.3 has been revoked and removed in favor of the release r2.4**

Following the recent approval of TS.43 temporary tokens usage in the ICM workgroup, it has been decided that this API will support them, enabling authentication over WiFi networks.

As a result, in release r2.4, both authentication methods are now available:
- AuthCode + network-based authentication
- CIBA + TS.43 temporary tokens

r2.4 is the official public release for Spring25 meta-release.
